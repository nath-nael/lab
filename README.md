# Jenius Academy – Interactive Learning Platform

## 📚 Overview
**Jenius Academy** is a web-based learning platform prototype built as a hands-on project to practice **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** fundamentals.  
The site simulates an educational service that prepares students for college entrance exams through engaging tools, personalized tutoring, and community-driven learning.

This project was my introduction to front-end development, where I explored layout structuring, styling, and basic interactivity without relying on frameworks.
